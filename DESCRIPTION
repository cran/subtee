Description: Naive and adjusted treatment effect estimation for subgroups. Model 
  averaging (Bornkamp et.al, 2016 <doi:10.1002/pst.1796>) and bagging 
  (Rosenkranz, 2016 <doi:10.1002/bimj.201500147>) are proposed to address the
  problem of selection bias in treatment effect estimates for subgroups. 
  The package can be used for all commonly encountered type of outcomes in
  clinical trials (continuous, binary, survival, count). Additional functions
  are provided to build the subgroup variables to be used and to plot the 
  results using forest plots. For details, see Ballarini et.al. (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v099.i14>.
